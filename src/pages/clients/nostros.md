1. If you don't have a private key, click to generate one, it will prompt you to generate a sequence of words: ![](/images/nostros-seed.jpg)
1. If you're serious about this you must note down the words, otherwise just go forward.
1. In the next screen, it will ask you to type all the words again, which you should do if you noted them down, but there is a "skip" button which you can click if you don't.

## Following people

1. At the beginning you're not following anyone, so the app you prompt you to go to the "Contacts" screen and paste a public key: ![](/images/nostros-notfollowing.jpg)
