## Coracle setup

1. Open https://coracle.social, it will ask you to either "log in" -- which means just paste your private key, or "sign up" -- which means create a new key. ![](/images/coracle-login.png)
1. Ideally you'll be using a browser extension and will use that method, but if you're just trying it's ok to click "sign up".
1. It will generate a keypair for you.

## Following people

1. At the beginning you're not following anyone, but if you go to "Search" you'll see suggestions of profiles of people to follow: ![](/images/coracle-follow.png)
1. You can also click on the "Advanced" tab you'll be able to paste `nprofile`, `npub` or other identifiers.
1. Clicking on one of the selected people will display their profile, from where you can click the icon to add them to your follow list: ![](/images/coracle-profile.png)
