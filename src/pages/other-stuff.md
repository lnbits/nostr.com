Nostr is not only made of tweet-style notes.

## Other Stuff

Most of the Nostr [clients](/clients) are specialized in _short notes_ (also known as _tweets_ or _microblogging_), but Nostr has [NIPs](/nips) that describe many other types of content that be published and consumed by specialized clients.

These include chat, marketplaces, Instagram-like photo feeds, long-form articles, Twitch-like livestreaming and even a highly-subjective decentralized wikipedia-like encyclopedia.

Besides this, you may also notice that some of the microblogging clients also have partially integrated some of the _other stuff_ content types above inside their feeds, which makes the entire thing even richer!
