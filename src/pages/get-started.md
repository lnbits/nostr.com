A step-by-step guide to getting started with Nostr.

## Understanding keys

Each Nostr account is based on a public/private key pair. A simple way to think about this is that your public key is your username and your private key is your password, with one major caveat. Unlike a password, your private key cannot be reset if lost.

The public key is generally presented as a string with the prefix `npub` and the private key with the prefix `nsec`. Make sure you store you private key somewhere safe, like a password manager.

### Keeping keys safe

If you are using Nostr on a web browser it is probably a good idea to install an extension like [Connect](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/nostr-connect/ampjiinddmggbhpebhaegmjkbbeofoaj), [nos2x](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nos2x) or [Alby](https://getalby.com/products/browser-extension), then input your secret key there (or it will generate a secret key for you). From there you will be able to use all web apps very easily with no worries. For the paranoid, keeping your key on a [hardware device](https://shop.lnbits.com/product/nostr-signing-device) is also an option.

If you are on Android, installing [Amber](https://github.com/greenart7c3/Amber/releases) is the safest way to use Nostr without having to paste your key directly into apps.

Otherwise it's probably safe to paste your `nsec` into well-established and security-minded apps such as [Damus](https://damus.io), so don't worry too much.

## Let's do this!

Now that you know what it takes, just [pick a client](/clients) to start using Nostr!

## Finding people to follow

If you know someone that is on Nostr, start by following them, then look at whom they are following and whom they are interacting with, and sooner rather than later you'll have a bunch of followers and a community for yourself inside Nostr.

Otherwise, you can always take a look at trending [posts](https://nostr.band/?trending=posts) and [people](https://nostr.band/?trending=people) and get people from there.
