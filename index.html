        Nostr doesn't have owners or organizations that control it — it's just a simple standard
        that allows a scalable architecture of clients and servers to interact. Combining old
        reliable technology with a new multi-master approach is the main innovation.

            Besides being a natural medium for a Twitter-like microblogging social network, Nostr
            can also be used for other purposes. And not only similar things like sharing
            <i>videos</i>, longform <i>articles</i>, <i>pictures</i> or <i>voice notes</i>. There
            are initiatives on Nostr for the development of sub-protocols that power
            <b>closed groups</b>, <b>decentralized wikipedia</b>, <b>couchsurfing</b>,
            <b>marketplaces</b> or <b>web annotations</b>; as well as protocols that don't use Nostr
            for the core data but as a coordination and discovery mechanism, such as
            <b>decentralized code collaboration using git</b>, <b>file hosting</b>,
            <b>torrent sharing</b> and <b>video livestreaming</b>.

            <p>
              In the default feed you never see any spam, because clients will only fetch
              information from people that <i>you</i> follow. In that sense no one can "push" spam
              into you.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's trickier when you want to see, for example, replies to your posts, in that case a
              client might be programmed to fetch anything that <i>claims</i> to be a reply
              <i>from anyone</i>, which might include spam.
            </p>
            <p>
              The way we can deal with it on Nostr is by restricting our area of contact with the
              spam: for example, some clients may easily decide to only display replies that come
              from people followed by people you follow. More refined strategies involve announcing
              and then only reading notes from relays known to be "safe" according to your criteria
              (could be relays that require payment, relays that do screening for humans, relays
              that only accept members of certain communities or political affiliations etc).
            </p>
            <p>
              There are no perfect solutions. But these do not exist anywhere, centralized platforms
              are also full of spam. Nostr at least isn't naïve and tries to build resiliency from
              the start.

            <p>
              Yes, Nostr is just a basic client-server architecture. And the fact that users can
              naturally spread among hundreds of different relays while clients can query dozens of
              relays that they're interested in at the same time means the network has a natural
              load balancer (which doesn't prevent a single relay from having its own internal load
              balancer either).
            </p>
            <p>
              Another (almost the opposite) concern that may be raised is with problems arising from
              clients having to connect to too many relays if the profiles being followed for
              whatever reason decide to spread way too much, but this shouldn't be a problem either
              because people tend to follow many accounts with similar content and these will tend
              to share relays. Still, if it happens, it's cheap for native apps to open many
              hundreds of WebSocket connections simultaneously (as they will be getting very few
              data in each of those). For web apps that isn't so hard, but we can still go up to a
              few hundreds without big problems. Regardless of any of that, in any complete enough
              app that wants to display a "following feed" it's already necessary to store events in
              a local database, and that will make all these issues easy to deal with as you can do
              the event requests in batches instead of all at once.

            <p>
              Harassment is similar to spam in the sense that anyone can still create the undesired
              content and publish to the relays that accept them. All the techniques mentioned in
              avoiding spam can also be applied in this case, but if we're talking about specific
              individuals with a permanent identity and not only an army of bots in this case the
              problem becomes easier, as those individuals can just be blocked by their target and
              their content will vanish. Presumably friends of such target will also block, and
              creative solutions involving shared blocklists can be created such that some people
              don't even have to click the block button directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other approaches involving, for example, relays with restricted read (that can emulate
              "protected account"/"only friends" features seen in centralized platforms) can further
              improve this.

            Why not just use Mastodon/Fediverse?

          <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2 mt-2">
            <p>
              There are many problems with Mastodon, mostly due to the fact that it doesn't rely on
              any cryptography. Because it cannot do the multi-master approach of Nostr due to lack
              of cryptography, identities are assumed to be "owned" by the server, which is fully
              trusted by its tenants. Mastodon server owners can do all the harm centralized
              platforms can do to their underlings, which are completely helpless in case of
              misbehavior or even in the normal case where a server owner loses their server or
              decides to shut down for whatever reason.
            </p>
            <p>
              Worse than that, for many of its purported features, such as blocking or direct
              messages, users have to also trust owners of the other servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are also problems with reliance on the DNS system, but we don't have to talk
              about those.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most interesting feature of Mastodon is that by its nature it creates communities
              with shared values that grow in each of its servers. Or, should I say, that should be
              a feature if it actually worked like that. In fact these are not really communities,
              but a mashup of users that may share some interests among each other, but also have
              other interests and those other interests end up polluting the supposed "community"
              with things that do not interest the other users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nostr, on the other hand, can create real communities around relays, specifically
              because users don't have to fully belong to those relays, but can go to them only for
              some of their needs and go to other relays for other needs.

              You could argue that Bluesky <code>Clients</code> could become smart and start
              sourcing data from multiple <code>AppViews</code>, or from multiple Relays, or that
              the <code>AppViews</code> could rely on multiple <code>Relays</code>, or that the
              <code>Clients</code> could talk directly to the <code>PDSes</code> — and all of that
              is possible and would indeed bring solutions, but notice that if those things started
              happening Bluesky would end up becoming Nostr, except with more steps.

              But basically the answer is the same as the question about scale: if users can go to
              whatever relay they want we'll see relays ran by all sorts of people and entities.
              Running servers is very cheap, and a relay can run on a $5/mo server and house at
              least a few thousand users. It's not hard to imagine relays ran by communities,
              individuals who just want to be useful to others, big organizations wanting to gain
              good will with some parts of the public, but also companies, client makers, and, of
              course, dedicated entities who sell relay hosting for very cheap.

              It's not a feature of the world at large to be able to see or hear everything that is
              happening everywhere at all times. Nostr inherits that property from the world, making
              it so that you can only see what you focus your attention on (and you're allowed to
              see by the relay that hosts that information).

            How does search work?

            <p>
              It's only possible to search on what you have seen, so search engines will always have
              to crawl some parts of the network they chose to and index those to enable public
              search. The word "chose" is employed because, as we know, there can't be a "global"
              view of the network (and no one would want such a thing anyway as it would be full of
              spam), so indexers have to choose. This is not different from Google deciding what
              websites to index.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, it's surprisingly doable for clients to store all the posts from
              people you follow, or all the posts you have seen or interacted with over time (since
              it's just text, a huge amount of notes can fit in the same space that would otherwise
              be required to store a single photo, for example) then provide local search over that.
              That kind of search will be sufficient for most of the cases you would reach out for a
              search bar in a centralized platform (which is to search for things that you have seen
              before), and perhaps even more useful since it would naturally filter out all the
              unrelated garbage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Last, niche or community-oriented relays can also provide very useful search
              capabilities by just indexing the notes they have stored locally, already filtered and
              scoped to that relay's topic or cohort (imagine searching over a Discord, Slack or
              Telegram group, for example).

            <p>
              The most basic way to do that is by following the natural habits used by most
              centralized social platforms users since a long time ago: by looking at the people you
              follow and whom they're interacting with.
            </p>
            <p>
              But also it's not true that Nostr doesn't have algorithms. Nostr can have algorithms
              of all kinds: manual, automatic, AI-powered or rule-based. Some of these algorithms
              can be run entirely locally on clients (for example, surfacing posts from the times
              when you were not online, or from people that make fewer posts), while other
              algorithms can be provided by all sorts of relays, either by naturally surfacing posts
              from a community of people you don't follow or by dedicated relays that have the
              stated purpose of curating content desirable for a target audience or even by
              targeting specific users.

            Is Nostr related to Bitcoin?

            <p>
              Nostr uses the same cryptographic principles of Bitcoin and was kickstarted mostly by
              a community of Bitcoiners, so it has disproportionately attracted the attention of
              Bitcoiners at the start, but aside from that it doesn't have any relationship with
              Bitcoin. It doesn't depend on Bitcoin for anything and you don't have to know or have
              or care about any Bitcoin in order to use Nostr.
            </p>
            <p>
              What about "zaps"? Zaps are a standard for tipping Nostr content using Bitcoin that is
              implemented by some Nostr clients, but it's fully and completely optional and if you
              don't care about Bitcoin you don't have to bother about it.
